/**
 * https://www.baeldung.com/hibernate-inheritance
 *
 * Using this strategy, each class in the hierarchy is mapped to its table.
 * The only column that repeatedly appears in all the tables is the identifier, which will be used for joining them when needed.
 *
 * The disadvantage of this inheritance mapping method is that retrieving entities requires joins between tables,
 * which can result in lower performance for large numbers of records.
 *
 * The number of joins is higher when querying the parent class because it will join with every single related child â€”
 * so performance is more likely to be affected the higher up the hierarchy we want to retrieve records.
