 * What is the synchronization process? Why use it?
 * Synchronization is basically a process in java that enables a simple strategy for avoiding thread interference and memory consistency errors.
 * This process makes sure that resource will be only used one thread at a time when one thread tries to access a shared resource.
 * It can be achieved in three different ways as given below:
 *
 * By the synchronized method
 * By synchronized block
 * By static synchronization
 *
 *
 *
 * What is thread starvation?
 * Thread starvation is basically a situation or condition where a thread wonâ€™t be able to have regular access to shared resources
 * and therefore is unable to proceed or make progress. This is because other threads have high priority and occupy the resources for too long.
 * This usually happens with low-priority threads that do not get CPU for its execution to carry on.
